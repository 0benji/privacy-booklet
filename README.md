# Privacy Booklet 

## Aims
This repository will host content and collaboration for a work-in-progress booklet about online privacy and security. We want to make a physical document that can be passed around with the same educational goals as projects like [privacytools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/), [PRISM Break](https://prism-break.org/en/), [Center for Humane Technology](https://www.humanetech.com/) and others.

The booklet is aimed at ordinary regular social/internet technology users, rather than developers or experts in IT, but ideally it will provide information that will be relevant and useful to as many people as possible.  

We will acknowledge that many people don't (yet) have the understanding, time or practical ability to become fully-fledged privacy warriors - if this reading this booklet causes someone to make one small change in the direction of protecting themselves and their friends from the bad guys, then it will have been a success.  

## Topics
Topics that we would like to discuss include (but are not limited to):
 - "The Problem"
   - The state of Surveillance Capitalism, and how companies mine their users to sell valuable predictive/manipulative products
   - How governments, police, political organizations etc. routinely access the "private"/"personal" data of users of the biggest social apps for any number of reasons
   - How the same organizations use social media platforms to manipulate the behaviour of populations
   - Specific problems with individual tools/apps/platforms/technologies
   - Why people should care/how is this problem affecting them/those they love
   - What the future may hold if no intervention is taken
 - Solutions
   - Technologies that people can use instead e.g. privacy-respecting apps
   - Approaches to improving privacy without having to make big lifestyle changes
   - Good ways to think about privacy and how data can travel/leak/follow you around, approaches to "opsec" for ordinary people
   - 

## Why help with this?
People love an attractive booklet, and a nice bit of printed media often sinks home a point better than a wall of internet text. Help change the minds of the people who are falling victim to invasions of privacy, abuses of digital power and cynical profiteering by governments and corporations all over the world. Share what you know and fight surveillance capitalism by spreading the knowledge. Convince a few more people to join that cool new E2EE chat app that you've only got 3 contacts on.  

All contributors to this repository will be credited in the final printed booklet.

## How to Help
Pull requests to add/change/remove content are gladly welcomed, and will be reviewed by the community, until the **deadline at 00:00am, 01/01/2021**. If you're adding content, don't worry too much about where exactly it might fit, as the ordering/arrangement of text passages is likely to shift around a bit as more stuff comes in. We would much rather you submit anything you have than not submit out of worry about its relevance/whether it is a good fit for some part of the book. We would also be grateful for PRs improving grammar/fixing typos/making writing clearer etc.  

Some topics (such as the title, inclusion of certain topics etc) will likely be discussed in GitHub issues, where some voting may take place.  

We haven't worked on this type of project in an open source way before, so we are going to play things by ear and would be keen to hear any suggestions from people about improvements to the collaboration process. Feel free to create an issue/comment on reddit/whatever.

After the deadline, the markdown content will be jazzed up into a stylish, short but sweet booklet by some trendy design people, and there will be a print run. The quantity and specifics of the print run depend a lot on how much interest there is in this project, but we anticipate being able to make copies available very cheaply, and obviously the more we are able to get made the cheaper they will be. We are keen to see the finished product distributed to people who want/need to see it, and would love to work with anyone who feels they could help spread the word with some copies.  

The final, styled booklet will also of course be available in digital format.

## Writing Information
### Format
 - The booklet content will be written here in [markdown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
 - The plan is for it to be about 16-24 A5 pages long.
 - Images are welcome if they can legally be included in a GPL3.0 document, good citations for factual information are strongly encouraged.
 - Right now the plan is to write the entire booklet as one markdown file (`booklet.md`), but this may change if it is decided that it would be better split into some other structure.
 
### Tone
 - We want to create a sense of urgency around privacy issues, not to spread fear or panic. Text contributions should be primarily factual and objective and allow the reader to make their own conclusions about the issues discussed. Writing should ideally be engaging to read.
 - Think somewhere between Wikipedia and a newspaper column.
